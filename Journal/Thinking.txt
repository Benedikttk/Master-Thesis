- I need to clean up in my code. I want to do this this week.
- I am not sure if the file that Im looking at reads as following dE|E_final|counts|....|, 
reasoning is that when i find the area where the Be10 should be using KNN, the when I sum the counts bellonging 
to this group it is and order higher then it should be. cant explane or understand as to why!!!!
- I also need to argue for why I am removing the outliers, i think i can use the average distance from the KNN
with optimal K values after K sillouete analysis.
Other option would be:
1. Outlier detection with Local Outlier Factor (LOF) ->https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neighbors/plot_lof_outlier_detection.html
2. Novelty detection with Local Outlier Factor (LOF) -> https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neighbors/plot_lof_novelty_detection.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-neighbors-plot-lof-novelty-detection-py
3. Average energy of cluster compaired to energy of the "assumed" outliers
4. Detecting Outliers with Angle-based Techniques in Python -> https://blog.paperspace.com/outlier-detection-with-abod/

--- 2 DoDo ---
* Code cleanup.                                         Status(Not finished -> in progres -> Finished)
* impliment outlier detection method.                   Status(Not finished)
* Questions for supervisor.                             Status(Not finished)

- Starting on cleanup, and what i mean is making tasks that need to be repatative as def functions
this also makes it easier to loop over and just automate, no?

- AARAMS_dE_Efinal functions made.

Date: 02-03-2025:
- Still doing cleanup of code, trying to just make what can be made into functions as def functions in Function.py file.

- ReadingEfficiencyFromAARAMS functions made 
- CalcPenDepthSRIM functioins made
- OptimizedGadDensity functions made

- Most files should be optimized now.

-Next step, should now be to optimized the KNN and start by simplifying it and implimenting the outlier detection methoid.
 ****SMALLPLAN****
 Perhabs tomorrow, 03-03-2025 I should impkiment what i have into my thesis paper, and look at the comments made by supervisor, thisn should help with "2 DoDo -> Questions for supervisor." Sooo->
